    "\n",
    "This notebook is a short, practical introduction to creating AI agents using the `google.adk` package. \n",
    "\n",
    "It shows how to configure credentials, build a simple agent, run it with an in-memory runner, and optionally launch the ADK web UI for interactive debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Derived from Day 1 of Google's \"5-day AI Agents Intensive\" codelab, this version is adapted so you can run it outside the original environment (e.g., locally or on Kaggle). Requirements: Python, the `google-adk` package, and a valid `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (the notebook will prompt or read from the environment if needed).\n",
