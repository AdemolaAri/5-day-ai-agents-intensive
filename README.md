# 🧠 5-Day AI Agents Intensive (by Google & Kaggle)

This repository tracks my progress through the [5-Day AI Agents Intensive](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-agents) course by Google and Kaggle.

Over 5 days, I’ll be building progressively advanced **AI agents and multi-agent systems** using Google’s **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** powered by **Gemini**.

---

## 🗓️ Course Overview

**Goal:** Learn how to design, build, and operate AI agents — from single-agent prototypes to complex multi-agent architectures — using Google’s ADK.

**Key Concepts Covered**
- Agent taxonomy and architecture
- Agent Ops (reliability, monitoring, governance)
- Multi-agent coordination patterns
- Secure agent identity and constrained policies
- Real-world use cases with Gemini and Google Search

## 📅 Daily Progress

| Day | Topic | Highlights | Repo Link |
|-----|--------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | Introduction to Agents | Built first Gemini + ADK agent, and a simple multi-agent system | [day1/](./day1) |
| 2 | Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Implemented minimal MCP-like wrapper for a tool result (simple JSON envelope) to ensure tool outputs are normalized across agents. | [day2/](./day2) |
| 3 | Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory | Implemented short-term and long-term memory layers using embeddings and persistent context stores | [day3/](./day3) |
| 4 | Agent Quality | Instrumented an agent with proper logs, traces, and simple metrics… then built an evaluator to grade its responses. | [day4/](./day4/) |
| 5 | Prototype to Production | Created remote agents and deployed a production-ready multi-agent system | [day5/](./day5/) |
| Capstone | 911 Agent Fleet Demo | Built and deployed a multi-agent fleet that ingests, triages, summarizes, verifies, and dashboards real-time Twitter data on a chosen topic | [capstone/](./capstone/) |

## 🎯 Why This Project

This repo is both a learning log and a showcase of hands-on work in building intelligent agent systems.  
By the end of the course, it will include:
- Working ADK-based agents and multi-agent demos
- Notes and takeaways from each module
- Code samples and architecture diagrams
- Reflections on Agent Ops, reliability, and interoperability
