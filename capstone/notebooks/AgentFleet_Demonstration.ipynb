    "# AgentFleet: Multi-Agent Emergency Response System\n",
    "## Agents for Good — A Comprehensive Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the AgentFleet demonstration! This capstone project showcases a **multi-agent system designed to save lives and protect communities** through intelligent emergency response and incident management using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌍 Why This Matters: Agents for Good\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentFleet represents how AI agents can benefit entire communities by:\n",
    "- **Reducing Response Time**: Automating incident triage and dispatch coordination\n",
    "- **Improving Accuracy**: Verifying claims and assessing reliability across multiple sources\n",
    "- **Saving Lives**: Prioritizing critical incidents for faster emergency response\n",
    "- **Supporting First Responders**: Handling data processing so human operators can focus on action\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo is a **proof-of-concept for what's possible**—imagine scaling this to coordinate emergency response across cities, regions, or entire nations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentFleet is an advanced multi-agent system that processes emergency events through a sophisticated pipeline of specialized AI agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ingest Agent** - Normalizes raw event data from various sources (social media, sensors, emergency feeds)\n",
    "2. **Verifier Agent** - Verifies claims and assesses source reliability to reduce false alarms\n",
    "3. **Summarizer Agent** - Creates concise incident summaries with historical context for operators\n",
    "4. **Triage Agent** - Classifies incident severity (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL) for prioritization\n",
    "5. **Dispatcher Agent** - Generates actionable recommendations and communicates with response teams\n",
    "6. **Dashboard Agent** - Creates markdown dashboards for human operators to visualize and manage emergency response operations\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The Dispatcher Agent is the fifth and final component in the AgentFleet pipeline. It receives triaged incidents from the Triage Agent and converts them into concrete action plans, communication templates, and persistent records for emergency response teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Import Dispatcher Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by importing the specialized tools that the Dispatcher Agent uses to generate actions, create communications, and persist incident data:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dispatcher Agent performs the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Receives triaged incidents** from the Triage Agent with severity classifications and priority scores\n",
    "- **Generates recommended actions** with specific steps, responsible parties, and realistic timelines\n",
    "- **Creates communication templates** for HIGH and CRITICAL severity incidents to alert response teams\n",
    "- **Persists incident data** to the database for historical tracking and audit trails\n",
    "- **Notifies the Operator Dashboard** to make incidents immediately visible to human operators\n",
    "- **Updates job status** to mark incidents as processed and ready for response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action Generation Guidelines:**\n",
    "- Provide specific, actionable recommendations tailored to severity level\n",
    "- Assign clear responsible parties (e.g., Fire Department, Police, Emergency Medical Services)\n",
    "- Include realistic response timelines based on incident severity and scope\n",
    "- Prioritize human safety and critical infrastructure protection above all else\n",
    "- Scale response scope appropriately (e.g., local response for LOW, regional coordination for CRITICAL)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Communication Template Guidelines:**\n",
    "- Use professional, clear, and concise language suitable for emergency personnel\n",
    "- Include all critical incident information (ID, severity level, location, brief summary)\n",
    "- List the top 3–5 priority actions in order of importance\n",
    "- Provide contact information placeholders for inter-agency coordination\n",
    "- Set clear expectations for next status updates and response milestones\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Capabilities:**\n",
    "- Multi-format action generation (structured recommendations for automated systems)\n",
    "- Template-based communication for rapid team briefing\n",
    "- Complete incident data persistence for regulatory compliance and post-incident analysis\n",
    "- Real-time dashboard updates for situational awareness\n",
    "- Seamless integration with existing emergency response infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent serves as the bridge between intelligent incident analysis and human-driven emergency response, ensuring that operators have everything needed to act decisively and effectively. By automating routine communication and documentation tasks, the Dispatcher Agent frees response teams to focus on saving lives."

The overall reliability score is 0.37. Due to the unverified nature of the core incident report, further investigation into the fire claim is recommended. The key facts extracted focus on the reported details and the source of the information, while also noting the low confidence in the fire report itself. The incident type was included as 'fire' based on the provided event details.\n"
